Before Starting: In this project I will bring together what I have learned throughout the "Setup" and "HTML" protion of the Odin Project.

After Action Review: I ran into a problem when I deleted a file locally so I had to figure out how to pull from the git repo to then properly delete the file. Also HTML isn;t too bad, everything is straight forward so far. Excited to to keep learning.
